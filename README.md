- Predictive Maintenance with Machine Learning using Python programming language and MATLAB (MATLAB Machine Learning Toolbox) to develop a system workable on a TinyML system 
   -> The system consists of datasets which are healthy datasets and different type of failure datasets. Using a variety of algorithms such as supervised and unsupervised, the system tries to understand
whether given data is coming from healthy system or failed system
   -> The system aims to optimize the maintenance process, increases availability and safety
   -> Nvidia Jetson Nano was used for edge computing
   -> Machine learning frameworks which are Scikit, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scipy were used
   -> Techniques such as Onehot Encoding, Confusion Matrix, Principal Component Analysis were also used
